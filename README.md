## Overview

## Learning objectives

Workshop participants will learn the basics of working with vector and raster data in `R`.

## Is this course for me?

You should be comfortable with routine R programming tasks (such as indexing vectors and lists).

Your (lack of) previous experience with geospatial analyses in R is not an issue. If you have experience, you'll see things in a new way. If you don't, we'll get you started on the right footing.

## Prework

1. Use your own system to install a working environment:
    - Download data from:
        https://github.com/jsta/glatos-spatial_workshop_learners/releases/download/0.0.1/glatos-spatial.zip
    - Install R and Rstudio
    - Install R packages
```r
install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "raster", "rgdal", "rasterVis", "sf", "mapview"))
# If you encounter errors you may need to install external prerequsite programs:
# https://datacarpentry.org/geospatial-workshop/setup.html
```

2. An alternative to (1) if you can't (or don't want to) use your own RStudio system--e.g. a laptop or an institutional server. Shortly before the workshop starts, open up a new project in `rstudio.cloud` by following this link: [rstudio.cloud/project/878317](https://rstudio.cloud/project/878317). 
    - You may be prompted to set up an account, which is free. If you already have an account, use that.
    - Your `rstudio.cloud` project is yours and you can leave it for future reference or delete it after the workshop: your choice.
    - Packages will be pre-installed and data will be pre-downloaded on `rstudio.cloud`
